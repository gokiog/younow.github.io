There are a number of different ways that we may collect personal information from you:

This information, as indicated during the connection process may, include your name, your activities, hometown, interests, likes, user location, your photos and videos, website, email, phone number, friends, online presence, social following and other. This registration process is optional for YouNow users who only wish to view content, but is required for users who would like to broadcast via YouNow or to use the Service's more advance options.

## **DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION**

Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required to do so by law or when necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Service, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm, financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.

In all cases, such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

We may also share your information with:
 - A third party performing services on our behalf that has agreed to keep such information confidential (such as excluding threats from potential cyber attacks or trolls or other security purposes, the processing of your credit card payment, if applicable, or the conduct of an online survey, for example).
 - One of our partners, but only if you've requested this in advance. Please note that in such cases, this Privacy Policy will not cover their information practices and we will not be responsible for the privacy practices exercised by any such partners.

## **SECURING THE INFORMATION**

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the information collected and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Service reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

Information received via 3rd party login schemes is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This ensures that your information is secure as it is sent over the Internet to our server. Furthermore, we have implemented procedures to ensure that your information is only made available to such designated staff as necessary to carry out the stated purposes that we have communicated to you.
In addition, we recommend that you do your part in protecting yourself from unauthorized access to your account by ensuring no one else uses your machine when you are logged in, by logging off from the Site when it is not in use and by keeping your password confidential.

A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web Site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a Site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web Site which may correlate other information, including personally identifiable information, with the cookie.

We use cookies to allow us to automate access and the data entry functions of our Site to tailor our Site to your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow us to track use of our Site to determine those areas, which are useful or popular and those that are not thereby enabling us to improve and update our Site effectively.

If you are not sure how to do this or whether you have this option you should consult the documentation that accompanied your web browser. You should be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of our Site may not function properly or permit access.

Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.
